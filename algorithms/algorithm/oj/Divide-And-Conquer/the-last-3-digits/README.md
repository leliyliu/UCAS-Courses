# the-last-3-digits
## Problem Description
Given two integers m and n, find the integer represented by the last three digits of m^n.

For example, if m=3 and n=9, the returned number should be 683(3^9=19683).

Please give an algorithm with O(logn) complexity.

Note: In a computer program, when m or n is large, exponential calculations may cause data overflow. Your algorithm should be able to avoid this problem.
